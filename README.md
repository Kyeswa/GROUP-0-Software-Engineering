Layers management farm project
That document "LMS SRS Ducument" is our software specification document. 
I want us to read it and make new design specifications. 
Let us dase our software on a Function Based Design in contrary to the Object Oriented Design  we had done earlier.
We will start with the major functions of the system.
The first Functional module we implement will be large but there will be very many modules we can reuse from it afterwards.
Hope you comply.
